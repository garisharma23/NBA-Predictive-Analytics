# NBA Players' Shot Analytics

## Motivation
- Sports, Sporting Events, and Athletes are a connecting point for individuals from anywhere and from any background. It gives us a common ground and an excitement to contemplate and debate, and gives us a chance to compete and be a fan.

- This NBA project was a motivating factor to show each other the intricacies of sports and how each team, each player, and each shot can impact a team and a players profile. It gave us both a better understanding of the game of Basketball on a fundamental basis.

##Questions Asked
A few questions we asked ourselves before starting the project:
- Can we visualize a players statistics (Points, Rebounds, Assists) over an entire season?
- What can this visualization show us about the player? (3-point scorer, mid-range shooter, etc.)
- Can we use the data visualizations to better understand where a player fits on a team and there value to the team?
- Can the data visualizations be used to help players improve their game as well as coaches to improve defensive schemes?

The size of the dots represent the relative probability of LeBron shooting from that position and the darkness of the dot illustrates his shot accuracy from that spot (with darker shades representing a higher accuracy).
